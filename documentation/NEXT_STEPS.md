# Next Steps - Post-Deployment Guide

## Completed Tasks

1. **AWS Lambda Deployment** - Successfully deployed to production
2. **DynamoDB Migration** - Migrated from SQLite to serverless database
3. **Frontend Updated** - docs/index.html points to new Lambda endpoint
4. **Documentation Created** - Comprehensive guides for deployment and implementation
5. **Changelog Created** - Version history tracked
6. **Timezone Fix** - Timestamps now use Eastern Time (America/Detroit)
7. **.gitignore Updated** - AWS-related files properly excluded

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Timezone Fix to Production

Update your Lambda deployment with the timezone fix:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is active
.\env\Scripts\activate

# Update Lambda with timezone fix
zappa update production

# Verify deployment
zappa tail production
```

---

### 2. Test Timezone Fix

**Verify timestamps are now in Eastern Time:**
1. Update a student record via the frontend
2. Check the `updated_at` field - it should show timezone offset (e.g., `-04:00` for EDT)
3. Time should match your local Michigan time, not UTC

**Using db_manager.py:**
```bash
.\env\Scripts\python.exe .\backend\db_manager.py
# Select option 2 to search for a student
# Check the created_at and updated_at timestamps
```

---

### 3. Commit All Changes to GitHub

```bash
# Stage all new and modified files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix timezone issue and update documentation (v2.3.0)

- Fix: Timestamps now use Eastern Time (America/Detroit) instead of UTC
- Add: zoneinfo module for timezone-aware timestamps
- Add: tzdata package to requirements.txt for Windows support
- Update: All documentation to reflect DynamoDB and timezone changes
- Update: CHANGELOG.md with v2.3.0 timezone fix"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

### 4. Monitor Your Deployment

**View real-time logs:**
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is active
.\env\Scripts\activate

# Tail Lambda logs
zappa tail production
```

**Check deployment status:**
```bash
zappa status production
```

---

## Ongoing Maintenance

### When You Make Code Changes

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
.\env\Scripts\activate

# 2. Test locally first
python main.py
# Visit http://localhost:5000 to test

# 3. Update Lambda
zappa update production

# 4. Test live endpoint
# Visit your frontend or test API directly

# 5. If frontend changes, commit and push
git add docs/index.html
git commit -m "Update frontend"
git push
```

---

### Common Zappa Commands

```bash
# Deploy (first time only)
zappa deploy production

# Update after code changes
zappa update production

# View logs in real-time
zappa tail production

# Check status
zappa status production

# Rollback to previous version
zappa rollback production

# Undeploy (remove everything)
zappa undeploy production
```

## Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Test Everything
- [ ] Test form submission with real data
- [ ] Test duplicate name detection
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Verify CORS is working properly
- [ ] Check logs for any errors

### Priority 2: DynamoDB Backup
- [ ] Enable DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- [ ] Export data to CSV using db_manager.py (option 9)
- [ ] Store backup in secure location
- [ ] Consider automated backups to S3

### Priority 3: Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboard
- [ ] Create alerts for errors
- [ ] Monitor Lambda duration
- [ ] Track API Gateway requests

### Priority 4: Security Hardening
- [ ] Review IAM permissions (use least privilege)
- [ ] Rotate AWS access keys regularly
- [ ] Consider API Gateway API keys
- [ ] Add rate limiting if needed

### Priority 5: Future Enhancements
- [x] Migrate to DynamoDB for persistent writes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fix timezone handling (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Add custom domain name
- [ ] Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add authentication for admin functions
- [ ] Create admin dashboard with analytics

## Cost Monitoring

### Check Your AWS Bill

1. Go to AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/
2. Check "Free Tier" usage
3. Verify you're within limits:
   - Lambda: < 1M requests/month
   - API Gateway: < 1M requests/month (first 12 months)

### Expected Monthly Usage
- **Requests**: ~100/month (very low)
- **Cost**: $0.00 (within free tier)
- **Alert threshold**: Set alert if > 10,000 requests/month

## Troubleshooting

### API Not Responding
```bash
# Check Lambda status
zappa status production

# View recent logs
zappa tail production

# Test specific endpoint
curl https://qkfsddvd8j.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/production
```

### Frontend Not Connecting
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API URL in docs/index.html (line 214)
3. Check CORS configuration in main.py
4. Test API endpoint directly with curl

### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Verify virtual environment
python --version  # Should be 3.12.x

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install zappa setuptools

# Try deploy again
zappa update production
```

### DynamoDB Issues
- Ensure Lambda role has `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` permission
- Check table exists in correct region (us-east-1)
- Verify table name is `wmu-students`
- Check CloudWatch Logs for specific error messages
