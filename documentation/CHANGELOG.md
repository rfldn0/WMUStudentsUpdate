## [2.4.0] - 2025-10-08

### üîß Frontend Refactoring & Bug Fix

#### Changed
- **Modular Frontend Structure** - Separated frontend code for better organization
  - `docs/index.html` - HTML structure only
  - `docs/script.js` - JavaScript logic (separated from HTML)
  - `docs/style.css` - CSS styles (separated from HTML)
  - Improved maintainability and code organization

#### Fixed
- **Script Loading Issue** - Fixed log output problem after data submission
  - Previous: Script loaded before DOM elements, causing form submission failures
  - Now: Script loads at end of body, ensuring all DOM elements exist
  - Form submission and message display now work correctly

---

## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-08

### üêõ Critical Fix: Timezone Correction

#### Fixed
- **Timezone Issue** - Timestamps now correctly use Eastern Time (America/Detroit)
  - Previous: Timestamps were stored in UTC (AWS Lambda default), causing 4-5 hour offset
  - Now: All timestamps use Eastern Time with automatic DST handling
  - Example: 8:00 AM update now shows `2025-10-08T08:00:00-04:00` instead of `2025-10-08T13:00:00`
  - Affects: `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in both main.py and db_manager.py

#### Added
- **Timezone Support** - Added `zoneinfo` module for timezone-aware timestamps
- **tzdata Package** - Added to requirements.txt for Windows compatibility
- **TIMEZONE Configuration** - Centralized timezone setting (`America/Detroit`)

#### Changed
- All `datetime.now()` calls updated to `datetime.now(TIMEZONE)`
- Timestamps now include timezone offset information (ISO 8601 format with timezone)

---

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-08

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Enhancements

#### Fixed
- **Smart Name Matching** - firstName + lastName duplicate detection
  - "Aprilia Mabel" now correctly updates "Aprilia Weni Irjani Mabel"
  - Prevents duplicate entries for same person with different name formats
  - Preserves full legal names in database

#### Added
- **Graduated Students Tracking** - Count and list graduated vs current students
  - Database Manager option #6: Count graduated students
  - Classifies by year field (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior vs graduation semester)
  - Shows breakdown and detailed list with graduation dates

#### Changed
- `find_student()` now prioritizes firstName + lastName matching over exact match
- `update_or_add_student()` preserves original full name from database
- Database Manager menu updated (1-10 options)
